# botgammon v1.0.0

This project is on hiatus

Virtual backgammon using OpenGL+SDL supporting many concurrent games with human or computer players for machine learning purposes.\
Currently nonfunctional, only a rotating triangle.\
Run botgammon/x64/Debug/botgammonOpenGL.exe on Windows for my results or build yourself.
